# PurpLabs
PurpLabs is a team that develops Discord Bots, those are: PurpBot(Not open source), PogBot, GroudonMusic.
# How are we better?
We do not have our bots and applications behind pay-walls, unlike some popular bots with premium memberships.
# History
## How it all started
It all started when the Founder, [ParaDuckey](https://github.com/ParaDuckey), had an idea of making a bot that would send a "Pog" emoji everytime someone would say "Pog."

Eventually, though, the bot would turn into a Dank Memer competitor and then the major developer of this project, [thrzl](https://github.com/thrzl), came along and helped turn it into what it is today, and more bots are being developed.

# Current Challenges
## Intents
One of our current struggles is trying to get the message content intent, one of the hardest intents to get. Without this, the chatbot, prefixed commands, and our original "pog" feature won't work.

## Hosting
Another one of our troubles is finding a host for the bot. Think you can help us out? Feel free to DM us on Discord. [ParaDuckey](https://discord.com/user/839514280251359292)

# What can you find here?
Here you can find the repository of the bots, but not PurpBot.

Thats pretty much all you can find. We will add more things here in the future.
